# My Portfolio

### Halfway through my portfolio project, all of my work vanished. I was trying to push my changes to github and all of it disappeared, so I had to rush to get this done in time. Obviously it is not the prettiest website, but I will continue to work on it and make it better throughout the course of the bootcamp.
